Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
This project focuses on training convolutional neural network (CNN) models for image classification tasks. The goal is to develop models capable of accurately categorizing images into predefined classes. Below is an overview of the key components and steps involved in the code:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Training data is loaded from a directory using tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory.
The data is split into training and validation sets with an 80-20 ratio to ensure model generalization.
Model Definition:
Several CNN models are defined using keras.Sequential().
Different architectures and configurations are experimented with, including varying numbers of convolutional layers, batch normalization, max-pooling layers, dropout regularization, and activation functions.
Each model is compiled with an optimizer (Adam), loss function (categorical crossentropy), and evaluation metric (accuracy).
Model Training:
Models are trained using the fit() function with the training dataset.
The training process involves iterating over a fixed number of epochs, updating model parameters to minimize the loss function.
Training progress is monitored, and validation accuracy and loss are evaluated.
Visualizing Training Results:
Training and validation accuracy and loss are visualized using matplotlib to understand model performance.
This visualization helps identify potential issues like overfitting or underfitting.
Results Analysis:
Trained models are evaluated on the validation dataset to analyze performance.
Predictions are made on a subset of validation images, and results are visualized alongside ground truth labels to assess model correctness.
Fine-Tuning:
Experimentation with different model architectures, regularization techniques, and hyperparameters is conducted to improve performance.
The iterative nature of model development is demonstrated, where multiple models and configurations are tested to achieve the best performance.
This project provides a comprehensive example of the typical workflow for training and evaluating deep learning models for image classification tasks. It covers data loading, model definition, training, evaluation, and result analysis.
